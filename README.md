# Mapping_Earthquakes
Using JavaScript and the D3.js library, we created an interactive map illustrating earthquakes around the world. On the map we can see the locations of earthquakes that have occurred in the past seven days, their location and magnitude. Tectonic plate lines were added to reference how close earthquakes occur.
